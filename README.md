# News_Application
# Description
This is a basic news application you see on the web every day. This project was implemented as a practice for API integration. 
I have used the News API (https://newsapi.org/) from newps api.org for fetching data from the web and display it through html and CSS.
I have designed a basic layout for the web using figma (https://tinyurl.com/5t396nha) and I have tried to keep the web exactly the same as my design. 

# Why this project?
1. This project is suitable for anyone who wants to understand the basics of API integration.
2. This project brushes up on the basics of HTML and CSS.

# Future scope of the project
1. Disintegrate the application into components for better optimization.
2. A Dropdown to select the news of the country for users.
